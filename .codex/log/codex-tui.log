+# MedisolveAI Backend Assignment Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### I. Self-Documenting Code
+- Code MUST communicate intent through precise naming, modular structure, and type hints; inline comments are reserved for domain invariants or trade-offs that cannot be expressed in code.
+- Public FastAPI handlers MUST use explicit async signatures (e.g., `async def get_patient`) and PEP 8 spacing to preserve readability without commentary.
+
+### II. Requirements Fidelity
+- Every deliverable MUST implement the latest approved requirements exactly; deviations require written change requests before coding.
+- Implementations MUST include pytest coverage that proves critical behaviors succeed and failure paths are handled deterministically.
+- Breaking regression tests or skipping agreed behavior is prohibited; fixes must preserve existing guarantees.
+
+### III. Performance-Centered Reliability
+- Services MUST target low-latency, stable execution paths by favoring O(1)/O(log n) operations and guarding against blocking calls in async contexts.
+- Performance-sensitive logic MUST include guardrails (timeouts, limits, graceful degradation) so the system stays responsive under load.
+- Any optimization MUST retain correctness; premature micro-optimizations that erode clarity are disallowed.
+
+### IV. Lean Dependency Footprint
+- Prefer Python’s standard library and FastAPI’s built-ins; introducing new packages requires justification of necessity and impact.
+- Dependencies MUST be pinned and tracked via `uv` so reproducible environments exist; unused packages MUST be removed immediately.
+- Docker images and runtime layers MUST remain minimal to reduce attack surface and startup times.
+
+### V. Isolated Assignment Domains
+- `Assignment1` (FastAPI) and `Assignment2` (pure Python) MUST share no runtime imports; shared utilities belong in dedicated internal modules with clear interfaces.
+- Each assignment MUST run independently via its own entrypoints, ensuring Task 2 scripts never auto-load FastAPI and vice versa.
+- After each major milestone, summarize outcomes in `task_report/` using the mandated title, 변경 사항 (when applicable), and 진행 사항 format.
+
+## Technology & Stack Constraints
+
+- Use Python 3.11+ with `uv` for environment and dependency management; commit lockfiles but never virtual environments.
+- Build the dermatology reservation API with FastAPI and prefer PostgreSQL 15+ for persistence; adopt MySQL only with stakeholder approval.
+- Compose services using Docker Compose; containers MUST expose FastAPI via Uvicorn and database services with persistent volumes.
+- Manual HTTP collections belong in `tests/manual/`, and routers belong under `Assignment1/app/routers/` to keep `main.py` lean.
+
+## Development Workflow & Reporting
+
+- Start each feature by drafting specs and plans that cite these principles; block implementation until the Constitution Check passes.
+- Guardrails: run `pytest -q` before commits, maintain async route segregation via `include_router`, and store shared logic under `Assignment1/app/core/` or `app/services/`.
+- Task 2 modules MUST remain pure Python with deterministic behavior and no FastAPI or database imports.
+- After completing significant deliverables, update `task_report/` entries with concise bullet points (using `- `) that capture titles, material changes, and current status.
+
+## Governance
+
+- This constitution supersedes conflicting guidance; violations block merges until remediated.
+- Amendments require documenting rationale, updating impacted templates, and versioning per semantic rules (MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new guidance, PATCH for clarifications).
+- Compliance reviews MUST verify dependency justifications, assignment isolation, testing evidence, and the latest task report entry before approval.

-**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
-**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
-**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

-**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
+**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
+**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, uvicorn[standard], uv, pytest, httpx  
+**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ (deviation to MySQL requires written approval)  
+**Testing**: pytest with httpx.AsyncClient for async routes  
+**Target Platform**: Docker Compose (FastAPI API + PostgreSQL + support services)  
+**Project Type**: Backend API (`Assignment1`) + standalone algorithm package (`Assignment2`)  
+**Performance Goals**: FastAPI endpoints p95 < 200 ms under assignment load; Task 2 functions O(log n) or better unless justified  
+**Constraints**: Minimal dependency footprint, async-safe handlers, assignments isolated with shared utilities explicitly documented  
+**Scale/Scope**: Single-team assignment deliverable; ensure each task ships independently runnable artifacts
 
 ## Constitution Check
 
 *GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
 
-[Gates determined based on constitution file]
+- **Self-Documenting Code**: Planned module names, router splits, and type hints make behavior clear without inline commentary. Note any unavoidable exceptions.
+- **Requirements Fidelity**: Scope matches assignment instructions exactly and lists the pytest coverage that will validate success and failure paths.
+- **Performance-Centered Reliability**: Identify potential bottlenecks, async blocking risks, and the guardrails that maintain responsiveness.
+- **Lean Dependency Footprint**: Enumerate all new dependencies with justification; confirm unnecessary packages are excluded and `uv` lockfiles stay minimal.
+- **Isolated Assignment Domains**: Clarify which assignment is impacted, how cross-task utilities are shared, and confirm independent entrypoints remain intact.

-# MedisolveAI Backend Assignment Constitution
-
-## Core Principles
-
-### I. Self-Documenting Code
-- Code MUST communicate intent through precise naming, modular structure, and type hints; inline comments are reserved for domain invariants or trade-offs that cannot be expressed in code.
-- Public FastAPI handlers MUST use explicit async signatures (e.g., `async def get_patient`) and PEP 8 spacing to preserve readability without commentary.
-
-### II. Requirements Fidelity
-- Every deliverable MUST implement the latest approved requirements exactly; deviations require written change requests before coding.
-- Implementations MUST include pytest coverage that proves critical behaviors succeed and failure paths are handled deterministically.
-- Breaking regression tests or skipping agreed behavior is prohibited; fixes must preserve existing guarantees.
-
-### III. Performance-Centered Reliability
-- Services MUST target low-latency, stable execution paths by favoring O(1)/O(log n) operations and guarding against blocking calls in async contexts.
-- Performance-sensitive logic MUST include guardrails (timeouts, limits, graceful degradation) so the system stays responsive under load.
-- Any optimization MUST retain correctness; premature micro-optimizations that erode clarity are disallowed.
-
-### IV. Lean Dependency Footprint
-- Prefer Python's standard library and FastAPI's built-ins; introducing new packages requires justification of necessity and impact.
-- Dependencies MUST be pinned and tracked via `uv` so reproducible environments exist; unused packages MUST be removed immediately.
-- Docker images and runtime layers MUST remain minimal to reduce attack surface and startup times.
-
-### V. Isolated Assignment Domains
-- `Assignment1` (FastAPI) and `Assignment2` (pure Python) MUST share no runtime imports; shared utilities belong in dedicated internal modules with clear interfaces.
-- Each assignment MUST run independently via its own entrypoints, ensuring Task 2 scripts never auto-load FastAPI and vice versa.
-- After each major milestone, summarize outcomes in `task_report/` using the mandated title, 변경 사항 (when applicable), and 진행 사항 format.
-
-## Technology & Stack Constraints
-
-- Use Python 3.11+ with `uv` for environment and dependency management; commit lockfiles but never virtual environments.
-- Build the dermatology reservation API with FastAPI and prefer PostgreSQL 15+ for persistence; adopt MySQL only with stakeholder approval.
-- Compose services using Docker Compose; containers MUST expose FastAPI via Uvicorn and database services with persistent volumes.
-- Manual HTTP collections belong in `tests/manual/`, and routers belong under `Assignment1/app/routers/` to keep `main.py` lean.
-
-## Development Workflow & Reporting
-
-- Start each feature by drafting specs and plans that cite these principles; block implementation until the Constitution Check passes.
-- Guardrails: run `pytest -q` before commits, maintain async route segregation via `include_router`, and store shared logic under `Assignment1/app/core/` or `app/services/`.
-- Task 2 modules MUST remain pure Python with deterministic behavior and no FastAPI or database imports.
-- After completing significant deliverables, update `task_report/` entries with concise bullet points (using `- `) that capture titles, material changes, and current status.
-
-## Governance
-
-- This constitution supersedes conflicting guidance; violations block merges until remediated.
-- Amendments require documenting rationale, updating impacted templates, and versioning per semantic rules (MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new guidance, PATCH for clarifications).
-- Compliance reviews MUST verify dependency justifications, assignment isolation, testing evidence, and the latest task report entry before approval.

+# MedisolveAI 백엔드 과제 헌장
+
+## 핵심 원칙
+
+### I. 자기 설명적 코드
+- 코드는 명확한 네이밍, 모듈화, 타입 힌트를 통해 의도를 드러내야 하며, 주석은 코드로 표현할 수 없는 도메인 불변식이나 트레이드오프에만 사용한다.
+- FastAPI 라우터 함수는 `async def get_patient` 형태의 명시적 비동기 시그니처와 PEP 8 들여쓰기를 유지해 주석 없이도 읽히도록 한다.
+
+### II. 요구사항 준수
+- 모든 산출물은 최신 승인 요구사항을 정확히 구현해야 하며, 변경이 필요하면 코딩 전에 서면 변경 요청을 남긴다.
+- 핵심 동작 성공과 실패 경로를 검증하는 pytest 테스트를 반드시 포함해 결정론적 동작을 증명한다.
+- 회귀 테스트를 깨뜨리거나 합의된 동작을 생략하는 행위는 금지하며, 수정 시 기존 보장을 유지한다.
+
+### III. 성능 중심 안정성
+- 서비스는 O(1) 또는 O(log n) 복잡도를 우선하며, 비동기 환경에서 블로킹 호출을 방지해 저지연 안정성을 지킨다.
+- 성능 민감 로직에는 타임아웃, 제한, 우아한 강등 등 보호 장치를 두어 부하 상황에서도 응답성을 유지한다.
+- 최적화는 정확성을 해치지 않아야 하며, 가독성을 떨어뜨리는 섣부른 미세 최적화는 허용되지 않는다.
+
+### IV. 경량 의존성
+- Python 표준 라이브러리와 FastAPI 기본 기능을 우선 사용하며, 신규 패키지는 필요성과 영향도를 입증해야 한다.
+- 의존성은 `uv`로 고정 및 추적하고 불필요한 패키지는 즉시 제거해 재현 가능한 환경을 유지한다.
+- Docker 이미지와 런타임 레이어는 최소화해 공격 표면과 기동 시간을 줄인다.
+
+### V. 과제 간 독립성
+- `Assignment1`(FastAPI)과 `Assignment2`(순수 Python)는 런타임 의존성을 공유하지 않으며, 공용 유틸은 명확한 인터페이스를 가진 전용 모듈에 둔다.
+- 각 과제는 독립 실행 진입점을 유지해 Task 2 스크립트가 FastAPI를 자동 로딩하지 않도록 보장한다.
+- 주요 마일스톤 후에는 `task_report/`에 작업 제목, 변경 사항, 진행 사항을 규격 형태로 요약한다.
+
+## 기술 및 스택 제약
+
+- Python 3.11+와 `uv`를 사용해 환경과 의존성을 관리하고, 잠금 파일은 커밋하되 가상 환경은 버전 관리에서 제외한다.
+- 피부과 예약 API는 FastAPI로 구현하며 기본적으로 PostgreSQL 15+를 사용하고, MySQL 전환은 이해관계자 승인을 선행한다.
+- Docker Compose로 서비스를 구성하고, FastAPI는 Uvicorn을 통해 노출하며 데이터베이스는 영속 볼륨을 사용한다.
+- 수동 HTTP 컬렉션은 `tests/manual/`에, 라우터 모듈은 `Assignment1/app/routers/` 아래에 배치해 `main.py`를 간결하게 유지한다.
+
+## 개발 흐름과 보고
+
+- 모든 기능은 본 헌장을 참조한 사전 기획과 설계를 작성한 뒤 구현하며, 체커 통과 전에는 개발을 시작하지 않는다.
+- 필수 가드레일: 커밋 전에 `pytest -q` 실행, `include_router`로 라우터 분리 유지, 공유 로직은 `Assignment1/app/core/` 또는 `app/services/`에 보관.
+- Task 2 모듈은 FastAPI나 데이터베이스 의존성 없이 결정론적으로 동작하는 순수 Python 코드를 유지한다.
+- 주요 산출 완료 시 `task_report/`에 `- `로 시작하는 불렛 리스트로 제목, 물리적 변경 사항, 현재 진행 상황을 간략히 기록한다.
+
+## 거버넌스
+
+- 본 헌장은 상충 지침보다 우선하며, 위반 사항은 해결될 때까지 머지를 중단한다.
+- 개정 시 근거를 문서화하고 관련 템플릿을 업데이트하며, 의미 변화 수준에 따라 버전을 MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH로 관리한다.
+- 검토 시 의존성 정당성, 과제 간 격리, 테스트 근거, 최신 `task_report/` 반영 여부를 확인해야 승인할 수 있다.

+# 기능 명세서: 메디솔브AI 백엔드 전형 과제
+
+**기능 브랜치**: `[001-medisolveai-backend-assignment]`  
+**작성일**: 2025-11-06  
+**상태**: 초안  
+**입력**: 사용자 설명: "/prompts:speckit.specify 메디솔브에이아이의 백엔드 전형 과제를 도와줘 ..."
+
+## 사용자 시나리오 및 테스트 *(필수)*
+
+### 사용자 스토리 1 - 환자 예약 플로우 (우선순위: P1)
+
+환자는 선호 의사와 진료 항목, 가능한 시간대를 선택해 예약을 생성하고 자신의 예약 내역을 확인·취소하고 싶다.
+
+**우선순위 이유**: 환자 예약은 시스템의 핵심 가치 제공 기능이며 전체 서비스 가치의 기반이 된다.
+
+**독립 테스트 방법**: `/api/v1/patient` 트리에 대한 통합 테스트로 예약 가능 시간 조회 → 예약 생성 → 조회/취소 흐름을 검증한다.
+
+**인수 시나리오**:
+
+1. **Given** 등록된 의사, 진료 항목, 병원 슬롯이 존재하고 **When** 환자가 가용 시간대로 예약을 생성하면 **Then** 예약이 `예약대기` 상태로 저장되고 초진/재진 판단이 기록된다.
+2. **Given** 환자가 예약을 보유하고 **When** 환자 조회 API를 호출하면 **Then** 본인 예약만 상태와 함께 반환된다.
+3. **Given** 환자가 예약을 보유하고 **When** 취소 API를 호출하면 **Then** 예약 상태가 `취소`로 갱신되고 이후 같은 시간대가 다시 노출된다.
+
+---
+
+### 사용자 스토리 2 - 관리자 운영 플로우 (우선순위: P1)
+
+관리자는 의사, 병원 시간대, 진료 항목을 관리하고 예약 현황 및 통계를 확인하며 예약 상태를 변경하고 싶다.
+
+**우선순위 이유**: 관리자 기능이 있어야 운영 정책(동시 수용 인원, 의사 편성 등)을 맞춰 환자 기능이 정상 동작한다.
+
+**독립 테스트 방법**: `/api/v1/admin` 트리에 대한 통합 테스트로 CRUD, 예약 상태 변경, 통계 조회 시나리오를 검증한다.
+
+**인수 시나리오**:
+
+1. **Given** 관리자 자격으로 의사 생성 요청을 보내고 **When** CRUD 엔드포인트를 호출하면 **Then** 해당 의사 정보가 DB에 반영된다.
+2. **Given** 여러 예약이 존재하고 **When** 관리자 예약 통계 API를 호출하면 **Then** 상태별/시간대별/초진-재진 비율이 정확한 수치로 반환된다.
+3. **Given** 관리자가 예약 상태 변경 API를 호출하면 **Then** 상태 전이가 허용 순서를 따르고 잘못된 전이는 4xx로 거부된다.
+
+---
+
+### 사용자 스토리 3 - 시스템 운영자 및 DevOps (우선순위: P2)
+
+운영자는 Docker Compose 한 번으로 전체 시스템을 기동하고, 마이그레이션이 자동 실행되며 테스트 명령으로 품질을 검증하고 싶다.
+
+**우선순위 이유**: 배포 및 실행 편의성은 채점 환경 재현과 제출 완성도를 결정한다.
+
+**독립 테스트 방법**: `docker-compose up`으로 서비스 기동 후 헬스체크, `pytest -q` 실행으로 환경 분리 검증 테스트를 수행한다.
+
+**인수 시나리오**:
+
+1. **Given** 프로젝트 의존성이 `uv`로 설치되고 **When** `docker-compose up`을 실행하면 **Then** DB 초기화가 완료된 뒤 게이트웨이/두 API가 기동된다.
+2. **Given** 테스트 환경 변수가 주어지고 **When** `pytest -q`를 실행하면 **Then** 모듈 간 독립 테스트가 통과하며 프로덕션 설정을 건드리지 않는다.
+
+---
+
+### 사용자 스토리 4 - 알고리즘 평가 담당자 (우선순위: P2)
+
+평가 담당자는 `Assignment2`의 난수 생성 로직을 독립적으로 실행하고, 테스트 및 보고서를 통해 구현 품질을 확인하고 싶다.
+
+**우선순위 이유**: Task 2는 별도 채점 항목으로, API와 독립적인 실행 및 검증 경로가 필요하다.
+
+**독립 테스트 방법**: `Assignment2/tests`에서 `pytest` 실행으로 통계적 분포 검증, 범위 검증 등을 수행하고 보고서 PDF 존재를 확인한다.
+
+**인수 시나리오**:

-# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]
-
-**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
-**Created**: [DATE]  
-**Status**: Draft  
-**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"
-
-## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*
-
-<!--
-  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
-  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
-  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
-  
-  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
-  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
-  - Developed independently

+# 기능 명세서: 메디솔브AI 백엔드 과제
+
+**기능 브랜치**: `001-medisolve-backend`  
+**작성일**: 2025-11-06  
+**상태**: 초안  
+**입력**: 사용자 설명: "메디솔브에이아이의 백엔드 전형 과제를 도와줘"
+
+## 사용자 시나리오 및 테스트 *(필수)*
+
+### 사용자 스토리 1 - 환자 예약 플로우 (우선순위: P1)
+
+환자는 선호 의사, 진료 항목, 가능한 시간대를 선택해 예약을 생성하고 자신의 예약 내역을 확인·취소하고 싶다.
+
+**우선순위 이유**: 환자 예약은 서비스가 제공하는 핵심 가치이며 모든 후속 기능의 기반이다.
+
+**독립 테스트 방법**: `환자 예약 가능 시간 조회 → 예약 생성 → 예약 조회 및 취소` 순으로 REST 통합 테스트를 수행하면 기능을 단독으로 검증할 수 있다.
+
+**인수 시나리오**:
+
+1. **Given** 의사, 진료 항목, 병원 슬롯이 준비되고 **When** 환자가 가용 시간대로 예약을 생성하면 **Then** 예약이 `예약대기` 상태로 저장되고 초진/재진 구분이 기록된다.
+2. **Given** 환자가 여러 예약을 보유하고 **When** 환자 예약 조회 API를 호출하면 **Then** 본인 예약만 상태와 함께 반환된다.
+3. **Given** 환자가 예약을 보유하고 **When** 취소 API를 호출하면 **Then** 예약 상태가 `취소`로 변경되고 해당 시간대가 다시 노출된다.
+
+---
+
+### 사용자 스토리 2 - 관리자 운영 플로우 (우선순위: P1)
+
+관리자는 의사, 병원 슬롯, 진료 항목을 관리하고 예약 상태 및 통계를 통해 병원 운영을 통제하고 싶다.
+
+**우선순위 이유**: 관리자 정책 설정이 있어야 환자 예약 정책이 안정적으로 작동하므로 최우선 기능이다.
+
+**독립 테스트 방법**: `/api/v1/admin` 엔드포인트에 대한 CRUD 및 통계 통합 테스트를 작성해 운영 기능만으로도 가치를 검증할 수 있다.
+
+**인수 시나리오**:
+
+1. **Given** 관리자 자격으로 진료 항목 CRUD API를 호출하고 **When** 새로운 항목을 등록하면 **Then** 해당 항목이 목록 조회에 즉시 반영된다.
+2. **Given** 여러 예약이 다양한 상태로 존재하고 **When** 통계 API를 호출하면 **Then** 상태별·시간대별·초진/재진 비율이 정확한 수치로 반환된다.
+3. **Given** 관리자가 예약 상태 변경 API를 호출하면 **Then** `예약대기 → 확정 → 완료/취소` 순서만 허용되고 잘못된 전이는 거부된다.
+
+---
+
+### 사용자 스토리 3 - 운영 환경 기동 (우선순위: P2)
+
+운영 담당자는 필요한 서비스를 한 번의 명령으로 기동하고, 자동 마이그레이션과 헬스체크를 통해 안정성을 확보하고 싶다.
+
+**우선순위 이유**: 배포 및 실행 편의성은 평가 환경에서 기능을 검증할 수 있는 필수 조건이다.
+
+**독립 테스트 방법**: Docker Compose 기동 후 게이트웨이와 각 서비스 헬스 엔드포인트를 점검하고, 실행일지에서 마이그레이션 성공 여부를 확인한다.
+
+**인수 시나리오**:
+
+1. **Given** 프로젝트 의존성이 준비되고 **When** 한 번의 명령으로 컨테이너를 띄우면 **Then** 데이터베이스 초기화 이후 게이트웨이와 두 API가 정상 기동된다.
+2. **Given** 환경 변수를 `test`로 지정하고 **When** 자동화 테스트를 실행하면 **Then** 운영 설정을 변경하지 않고 독립 DB로 모든 테스트가 통과한다.
+
+---
+
+### 사용자 스토리 4 - 난수 생성 검증 (우선순위: P2)
+
+평가 담당자는 `Assignment2` 난수 모듈을 독립적으로 실행하고 통계적 테스트 및 보고서를 통해 품질을 확인하고 싶다.
+
+**우선순위 이유**: Task 2는 별도 평가 항목이므로 API와 분리된 검증 경로가 필수다.
+
+**독립 테스트 방법**: 난수 모듈 단위 테스트에서 범위, 균등 분포, 경계값 시나리오를 실행하고 결과를 보고서에 반영한다.
+
+**인수 시나리오**:
+
+1. **Given** `get_1_or_0` 함수가 정의되어 있고 **When** 충분한 횟수로 호출하면 **Then** 0과 1이 허용 오차 내에서 균등하게 반환된다.
+2. **Given** `get_random(n)` 함수를 여러 n 값으로 호출하면 **Then** 모든 결과가 0 이상 n 이하에 포함되고 분포 편향이 허용 오차 이내다.
+3. **Given** 테스트 스위트를 실행하면 **Then** 통계 검증과 경계값 검사가 모두 통과하고 보고서에 요약된다.
+
+---
+
+### 에지 케이스

-- **Self-Documenting Code**: Planned module names, router splits, and type hints make behavior clear without inline commentary. Note any unavoidable exceptions.
-- **Requirements Fidelity**: Scope matches assignment instructions exactly and lists the pytest coverage that will validate success and failure paths.
-- **Performance-Centered Reliability**: Identify potential bottlenecks, async blocking risks, and the guardrails that maintain responsiveness.
-- **Lean Dependency Footprint**: Enumerate all new dependencies with justification; confirm unnecessary packages are excluded and `uv` lockfiles stay minimal.
-- **Isolated Assignment Domains**: Clarify which assignment is impacted, how cross-task utilities are shared, and confirm independent entrypoints remain intact.
+- **Self-Documenting Code**: 라우터/서비스/스키마 네이밍을 명확히 하고 타입 힌트를 제공한다. 예외 없음.
+- **Requirements Fidelity**: 스펙의 기능 요구사항을 1:1로 반영하고 pytest 시나리오를 계획한다.
+- **Performance-Centered Reliability**: 예약 생성 시 동시성 제어(락/재시도), 비동기 DB 호출 사용, 타임아웃 정의 필요.
+- **Lean Dependency Footprint**: 필수 라이브러리만 도입하고 ORM 채택 시 정당화가 필요하다.
+- **Isolated Assignment Domains**: Assignment1/Assignment2 디렉터리와 의존성을 분리하고 공용 유틸은 별도 모듈에 둔다.

-**Structure Decision**: Document the specific subdirectories and files this feature touches, confirming the assignment boundaries stay intact.
+**Structure Decision**: Assignment1은 `app/core`, `app/routers/patient`, `app/routers/admin`, `app/services`, `app/db` 구조로 구성하고, 게이트웨이는 별도 모듈(`assignment1/app/gateway`)에서 라우팅을 담당한다. Assignment2는 `src/algorithms/randomizer.py`와 `tests/test_randomizer.py`, `reports/`를 포함한다. Docker 설정은 `Assignment1/docker/compose/`에 위치시킨다.

+## ORM 선정
+- **Decision**: SQLAlchemy 2.x Async + Alembic  
+- **Rationale**: FastAPI와의 호환성이 높고 비동기 세션(`async_engine`)으로 예약 생성 시 동시성 제어를 쉽게 구현할 수 있다. Alembic과 연계하면 요구사항인 마이그레이션 자동화도 충족한다.  
+- **Alternatives considered**:  
+  - Tortoise ORM: 비동기 최적화지만 Alembic과의 연동이 제한적이라 마이그레이션 관리가 번거롭다.  
+  - 순수 SQL + Databases 패키지: 의존성은 줄지만 관계 정의, 락 관리, 스키마 버전 관리가 수동으로 복잡해진다.
+
+## 부하 테스트 접근법
+- **Decision**: pytest + httpx.AsyncClient + asyncio.gather 기반 동시 요청 시나리오  
+- **Rationale**: 이미 테스트 스택으로 활용할 라이브러리만으로 동시 20건 요청을 재현할 수 있어 의존성을 추가하지 않는다. 측정은 `time.perf_counter`로 p95를 계산한다.  
+- **Alternatives considered**:  
+  - locust: 전용 부하 도구지만 추가 러닝 커브와 의존성이 발생한다.  
+  - k6: 강력한 CLI지만 Go 런타임 설치가 필요하고 과제 범위를 벗어나는 무게다.

+# 데이터 모델 설계: 메디솔브AI 백엔드 과제
+
+## 개요
+- DBMS: MySQL 8.x (Docker Compose, 포트 29906)
+- 마이그레이션: Alembic (SQLAlchemy async 엔진 기반)
+- 기본 규칙: 모든 테이블은 `id` PK(BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT), 생성/수정 시각(`created_at`, `updated_at` TIMESTAMP) 포함
+- 타임존: KST 기준 저장, DB에는 UTC로 저장 후 애플리케이션에서 변환
+
+## 엔터티 상세
+
+### 1. doctors
+| 필드 | 타입 | 제약 | 설명 |
+|------|------|------|------|

+| memo | TEXT | NULL | 메모 |
+| created_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | 생성 시각 |
+| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | 수정 시각 |
+
+- 제약: `(doctor_id, start_at)` UNIQUE (기본), 추가로 슬롯 점유용 중간 테이블 사용
+- 인덱스: `idx_appointments_patient` (patient_id, start_at), `idx_appointments_status` (status)
+
+### 6. appointment_slots (슬롯 점유 매핑)
+| 필드 | 타입 | 제약 | 설명 |

+| slot_date | DATE | PK | 슬롯 적용 일자 |
+
+- 제약: `(slot_id, slot_date)`에 `capacity` 이상 예약 불가 → 트리거나 애플리케이션 로직에서 검증 후 INSERT
+- INSERT 시 트랜잭션 내 동시성 제어 필요 (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE)
+
+### 7. system_configs (선택)
+| 필드 | 타입 | 제약 | 설명 |
+|------|------|------|------|
+| id | BIGINT | PK | 설정 ID |

+- patients (1) —— (N) appointments —— (1) doctors
+- appointments —— (1) treatments
+- appointments —— (N) appointment_slots —— (1) hospital_slots
+- doctors —— (N) patients (optional 선호 관계)
+
+## 상태 전이
+- 예약 상태: `PENDING` → `CONFIRMED` → (`COMPLETED` or `CANCELLED`)
+- 상태 전이는 관리자 API에서만 허용, 하위 단계로 되돌릴 수 없음
+
+## 동시성/락 전략
+- 예약 생성 시:  
+  1. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`로 `hospital_slots`와 해당 날짜의 `appointment_slots` 점유 수를 잠금  
+  2. 수용 인원 확인 후 `appointments` 및 `appointment_slots`를 INSERT  
+  3. 커밋 실패 시 롤백하고 재시도 정책 적용
+- 상태 변경 시: `appointments` 행을 `SELECT FOR UPDATE` 후 갱신
+
+## 마이그레이션 초기화
+- `alembic init` 구조 사용, 기본 리비전에서 위 테이블들을 생성
+- Docker Compose 기동 시 `alembic upgrade head` 실행 또는 초기 SQL 스크립트 제공

+- 베이스 URL: `http://localhost:8000`
+- 내부 서비스 매핑:
+  - `/api/v1/patient/**` → Patient API 서비스 (`http://patient-api:8001`)
+  - `/api/v1/admin/**` → Admin API 서비스 (`http://admin-api:8002`)
+- 요청/응답은 투명하게 프록시되며, 게이트웨이는 다음 공통 기능을 담당한다.
+  - 요청 로깅 (구조화된 JSON)
+  - 에러 매핑: 내부 서비스의 5xx 응답을 게이트웨이에서 502로 래핑하고 추적 ID를 부여
+  - 타임아웃: 서브 요청 5초, 연결 2초
+  - 헬스체크 엔드포인트: `GET /healthz` → 각 서비스 헬스 확인 후 통합 결과 반환
+
+## 헬스체크 응답 형식
+```json
+{
+  "gateway": "ok",
+  "patient_api": "ok",
+  "admin_api": "degraded",
+  "timestamp": "2025-11-06T09:00:00Z"
+}
+```
+
+- `degraded` 상태 시 게이트웨이는 503을 반환하고 클라이언트에게 재시도를 안내한다.

+# Quickstart: 메디솔브AI 백엔드 과제
+
+## 1. 요구 도구
+- Python 3.11+
+- uv (패키지 관리자)  
+  ```bash
+  pip install uv
+  ```
+- Docker & Docker Compose v2
+- Make (선택) 또는 제공된 쉘 스크립트
+
+## 2. 리포지토리 클론 후 초기화
+```bash
+git clone <repo-url>
+cd medisolveai_assignment
+uv sync
+```
+
+## 3. 환경 변수
+- `.env.development` 예시
+  ```
+  MYSQL_HOST=localhost
+  MYSQL_PORT=29906
+  MYSQL_USER=medisolve
+  MYSQL_PASSWORD=medisolve
+  MYSQL_DB=medisolve
+  ```
+- `.env.test`는 별도 테스트 DB 또는 SQLite(in-memory) 사용 가능
+
+## 4. Docker Compose 실행
+```bash
+cd Assignment1/docker/compose
+docker-compose up --build
+```
+- 컨테이너 구성
+  - `gateway` : 8000
+  - `patient-api` : 8001
+  - `admin-api` : 8002
+  - `mysql` : 3306 (호스트 29906에 포워딩)
+- 최초 기동 시 `alembic upgrade head` 실행으로 스키마 생성
+
+## 5. 로컬 실행 (선택)
+```bash
+uv run uvicorn Assignment1.main_gateway:app --reload
+uv run uvicorn Assignment1.main_patient:app --port 8001 --reload
+uv run uvicorn Assignment1.main_admin:app --port 8002 --reload
+```
+- MySQL은 Docker 컨테이너를 사용하거나 로컬 설치 버전을 29906 포트에 맞춘다.
+
+## 6. 테스트 실행
+```bash
+uv run pytest -q
+```
+- 통합 테스트: httpx.AsyncClient로 게이트웨이를 통해 호출
+- 동시성 테스트: `tests/performance/test_reservations.py`에서 20건 동시 호출 검증
+- Assignment2 테스트: `Assignment2/tests/test_randomizer.py`
+
+## 7. 헬스 체크
+- 게이트웨이: `GET http://localhost:8000/healthz`
+- Patient API: `GET http://localhost:8001/health`
+- Admin API: `GET http://localhost:8002/health`
+
+## 8. 종료 및 정리
+```bash
+docker-compose down -v
+```
+- 필요 시 `alembic downgrade base`로 스키마 초기화

+
+---
+
+## Dependencies & Execution Order
+
+### Phase Dependencies
+
+- Setup 완료 후 Foundational 진행
+- Foundational 완료 후 US1/US2 병렬 가능 (두 스토리 모두 P1)
+- US3는 Docker/게이트웨이를 다루므로 US1/US2 완료 후 진행 권장
+- US4는 Assignment1과 독립적이므로 Foundational 이후 언제든 실행 가능
+- Polish는 모든 사용자 스토리 구현 완료 후 수행
+
+### User Story Dependencies
+
+- **US1 (P1)**: Foundational 작업 의존, 완료 시 환자 기능 MVP 달성
+- **US2 (P1)**: Foundational 작업 의존, 환자 기능과 독립 엔드포인트 제공
+- **US3 (P2)**: US1·US2 결과를 연결해 전체 환경 기동
+- **US4 (P2)**: Foundational 이후 독립 진행, Assignment1과 직접 의존성 없음
+
+### Within Each User Story
+
+- 스키마 → 서비스 → 라우터 → 앱 엔트리 → 테스트 순서 권장
+- 테스트는 구현 직후 작성하며 실패 상태를 확인한 뒤 통과시킨다.
+- 트랜잭션/동시성 로직은 서비스 레이어에서 집중적으로 검증한다.
+
+### Parallel Opportunities
+
+- [P]로 표시된 스키마/테스트 작업은 담당자가 다르면 병렬 처리 가능
+- US1과 US2는 Foundational이 끝나면 서로 다른 팀원이 동시에 진행 가능
+- US4는 Assignment1과 독립적이므로 별도 담당자가 초기부터 병렬 진행 가능
+
+---
+
+## Implementation Strategy
+
+### MVP First (User Story 1만 우선)
+1. Setup 및 Foundational 완료
+2. US1 구현 및 테스트 통과
+3. 게이트웨이 없이도 환자 예약 기능을 독립 검증
+
+### Incremental Delivery
+1. US1 배포 → 환자 기능 제공  
+2. US2 배포 → 운영 기능 확보  
+3. US3 배포 → Docker Compose와 게이트웨이 통합  
+4. US4 완료 → 난수 모듈 평가 자료 제공
+
+### Parallel Team Strategy
+- 팀 A: Foundational 이후 US1 집중
+- 팀 B: Foundational 이후 US2 + 게이트웨이 준비
+- 팀 C: US4 난수 모듈 및 보고서
+- 마무리 단계에서 합동으로 Polish 항목 정리

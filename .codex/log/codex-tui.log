+# MedisolveAI Backend Assignment Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### I. Self-Documenting Code
+- Code MUST communicate intent through precise naming, modular structure, and type hints; inline comments are reserved for domain invariants or trade-offs that cannot be expressed in code.
+- Public FastAPI handlers MUST use explicit async signatures (e.g., `async def get_patient`) and PEP 8 spacing to preserve readability without commentary.
+
+### II. Requirements Fidelity
+- Every deliverable MUST implement the latest approved requirements exactly; deviations require written change requests before coding.
+- Implementations MUST include pytest coverage that proves critical behaviors succeed and failure paths are handled deterministically.
+- Breaking regression tests or skipping agreed behavior is prohibited; fixes must preserve existing guarantees.
+
+### III. Performance-Centered Reliability
+- Services MUST target low-latency, stable execution paths by favoring O(1)/O(log n) operations and guarding against blocking calls in async contexts.
+- Performance-sensitive logic MUST include guardrails (timeouts, limits, graceful degradation) so the system stays responsive under load.
+- Any optimization MUST retain correctness; premature micro-optimizations that erode clarity are disallowed.
+
+### IV. Lean Dependency Footprint
+- Prefer Python’s standard library and FastAPI’s built-ins; introducing new packages requires justification of necessity and impact.
+- Dependencies MUST be pinned and tracked via `uv` so reproducible environments exist; unused packages MUST be removed immediately.
+- Docker images and runtime layers MUST remain minimal to reduce attack surface and startup times.
+
+### V. Isolated Assignment Domains
+- `Assignment1` (FastAPI) and `Assignment2` (pure Python) MUST share no runtime imports; shared utilities belong in dedicated internal modules with clear interfaces.
+- Each assignment MUST run independently via its own entrypoints, ensuring Task 2 scripts never auto-load FastAPI and vice versa.
+- After each major milestone, summarize outcomes in `task_report/` using the mandated title, 변경 사항 (when applicable), and 진행 사항 format.
+
+## Technology & Stack Constraints
+
+- Use Python 3.11+ with `uv` for environment and dependency management; commit lockfiles but never virtual environments.
+- Build the dermatology reservation API with FastAPI and prefer PostgreSQL 15+ for persistence; adopt MySQL only with stakeholder approval.
+- Compose services using Docker Compose; containers MUST expose FastAPI via Uvicorn and database services with persistent volumes.
+- Manual HTTP collections belong in `tests/manual/`, and routers belong under `Assignment1/app/routers/` to keep `main.py` lean.
+
+## Development Workflow & Reporting
+
+- Start each feature by drafting specs and plans that cite these principles; block implementation until the Constitution Check passes.
+- Guardrails: run `pytest -q` before commits, maintain async route segregation via `include_router`, and store shared logic under `Assignment1/app/core/` or `app/services/`.
+- Task 2 modules MUST remain pure Python with deterministic behavior and no FastAPI or database imports.
+- After completing significant deliverables, update `task_report/` entries with concise bullet points (using `- `) that capture titles, material changes, and current status.
+
+## Governance
+
+- This constitution supersedes conflicting guidance; violations block merges until remediated.
+- Amendments require documenting rationale, updating impacted templates, and versioning per semantic rules (MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new guidance, PATCH for clarifications).
+- Compliance reviews MUST verify dependency justifications, assignment isolation, testing evidence, and the latest task report entry before approval.

-**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
-**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
-**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
-**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

-**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
+**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
+**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, uvicorn[standard], uv, pytest, httpx  
+**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ (deviation to MySQL requires written approval)  
+**Testing**: pytest with httpx.AsyncClient for async routes  
+**Target Platform**: Docker Compose (FastAPI API + PostgreSQL + support services)  
+**Project Type**: Backend API (`Assignment1`) + standalone algorithm package (`Assignment2`)  
+**Performance Goals**: FastAPI endpoints p95 < 200 ms under assignment load; Task 2 functions O(log n) or better unless justified  
+**Constraints**: Minimal dependency footprint, async-safe handlers, assignments isolated with shared utilities explicitly documented  
+**Scale/Scope**: Single-team assignment deliverable; ensure each task ships independently runnable artifacts
 
 ## Constitution Check
 
 *GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
 
-[Gates determined based on constitution file]
+- **Self-Documenting Code**: Planned module names, router splits, and type hints make behavior clear without inline commentary. Note any unavoidable exceptions.
+- **Requirements Fidelity**: Scope matches assignment instructions exactly and lists the pytest coverage that will validate success and failure paths.
+- **Performance-Centered Reliability**: Identify potential bottlenecks, async blocking risks, and the guardrails that maintain responsiveness.
+- **Lean Dependency Footprint**: Enumerate all new dependencies with justification; confirm unnecessary packages are excluded and `uv` lockfiles stay minimal.
+- **Isolated Assignment Domains**: Clarify which assignment is impacted, how cross-task utilities are shared, and confirm independent entrypoints remain intact.
